Diy model radio control system based on Jennic IEEE 802.15.4 radio modules

This is a diy 2.4GHz radio control project with the following features:-
  * Two way communications - the model can send data back such as receiver battery voltage, signal strength and gps data.
  * Choice of input devices - Custom transmitter, wii nunchuck, ps2 controller, standard transmitter buddy box output.
  * Open source software and hardware.

The project uses Jennic 2.4ghz transceiver modules, these have a on chip 32bit processor and lots of peripherals. There is enough power and space on the on chip processor to produce a fully functional rc transmitter and receiver with a minimum of external components.

All the software development tools required to develop software for the modules can be downloaded free from the Jennic site.

To download software to the module's flash memory, a logic level serial port is required.
